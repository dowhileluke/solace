* Based on the assignment, I expected Tailwind wouldn't need any configuration, but I took a little extra time to clean up some errors I was encountering. 

* Being stretched for time already, I did not make any changes to the db/api features, though I would have liked to build pagination since a real app would have a much larger data set. I *did* develop the AdvocateQueryForm in anticipation of being able to query for results rather than relying on an immediate data set being delivered. 

* The query form definitely needs labels for clarity, and should probably have different ways to filter the data, but I mostly stuck to the existing format. 

* I would have preferred to spend more time styling my components with additional fonts, colors, and spacing to keep the information as recognizable as possible, but I think this isn't too bad for the time constraints and no formal design specs. 

* I didn't commit any time to writing tests for any components or functions, which would have been nice to have.

* I am also not completely confident on my query token matching logic; I would like there to be more flexibility with non-English character sets.
